Modules Description
=========================

In the following the Tomography module is described.
It consists of two classes::

	* DensityMatrix
	* Errorize

The DensityMatrix class is used to calculate the density matrix, some quantum measures, and the pure state closest to the found density matrix. The Errorize class is used to compute uncertainties of the values computed in the DensityMatrix class by means of a Monte Carlo simulation.
